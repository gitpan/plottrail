NAME
    plottrail - plots GPS trails from longitude/latitude files as PNG images

SYNOPSYS
    plottrail --infile=input-file [--outfile=output-file]
    [--points-only] [--grid-interval=seconds] [--width=image-width]
    [--height-image-height]

REQUIREMENTS
    The following (non-standard) Perl modules are required:

    Carp::Assert
    GD

DESCRIPTION
    plottrail plots GPS longitude/latitude files as PNG images.

    Trail points are scaled within the image size, and are not in
    proportion. The points are also not adjusted for the curvature of the
    earth.

CAVEATS
    This script is a quick and dirty hack to view trail files. It has not
    been tested with points from the southern hemisphere or east of the
    Greenwich Meridian.
